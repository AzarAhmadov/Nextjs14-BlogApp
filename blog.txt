 <h2>Next.js Overview</h2>
      <p>Next.js is an open-source React framework developed by Vercel (formerly known as Zeit) that is used for building server-side rendered (SSR) and statically generated web applications. It is built on top of React, providing a more opinionated and feature-rich environment for developing React applications.</p>

      <h3>Key Features and Concepts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1)<strong>Server-Side Rendering (SSR):</strong> Next.js allows developers to render React components on the server side before sending them to the client, which can improve performance and enable search engine optimization (SEO).</li>
        <li>2)<strong>Static Site Generation (SSG):</strong> Next.js supports static site generation, where pages are pre-rendered at build time rather than on each request, significantly improving performance.</li>
        <li>3)<strong>File-Based Routing:</strong> Next.js uses a simple file-based routing system, where each page corresponds to a file in the project directory structure.</li>
        <li>4)<strong>Automatic Code Splitting:</strong> Next.js automatically splits JavaScript bundles based on the page boundaries, allowing for faster initial page loads and better performance optimization.</li>
        <li>5)<strong>API Routes:</strong> Next.js provides built-in support for creating API routes within the same project, simplifying the development of backend functionality.</li>
        <li>6)<strong>CSS and Styling:</strong> Next.js supports various methods for styling React components, including CSS modules, styled-components, and inline styles.</li>
        <li>7)<strong>Static Asset Handling:</strong> Next.js handles static assets like images, fonts, and other resources out of the box, automatically optimizing and serving them to the client.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Next.js has gained popularity among developers for its ease of use, performance optimizations, and built-in features that streamline the development process.</p>
